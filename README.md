- 👋 Hi, I’m @sagarikajandhyala
- 👀 I’m interested in: meaningful tech, smart design, and ideas that actually *matter*. I love exploring the intersection of creativity, logic, and purpose.  
- 🌱 Currently learning: how to build things that are as impactful as they are beautiful — and refining my skills in full-stack dev, UX, and systems thinking.  
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on: passion-driven projects, tools that empower people, and anything that’s bold, future-facing, and built with care.  
- 📫 Reach me: sagaj1703@gmail.com  
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I ask *why* five times before I touch the code — and I think "just because it works" isn't a good enough reason.
